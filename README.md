# How it works

  - Once you open the file, you will see crosshair pointer. New ball will be created with every single click on canvas area.
  - Each ball will start with random angle, random speed and one of 10 different colours. ( different colours are useful for debuging purpose)
  - Each ball will eventually stop at the buttom of the area after a while.
